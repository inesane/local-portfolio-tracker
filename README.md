  - [AMFI India](https://www.amfiindia.com/) (ISIN to scheme code mapping)
  - [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) (crypto prices, free tier — 365-day history limit)
  - [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) (India CPI for inflation adjustment)

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `curl` (used for Yahoo Finance API calls)

### Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/inesane/local-portfolio-tracker.git

The app runs at `http://localhost:5050`.

1. Download your tradebook(s) from Zerodha Console (separate CSVs for EQ and MF segments; tradebooks have 365 day limits so you'll need to download multiple)
2. Click **Import** in the app, select "Zerodha Tradebook (CSV)"
3. Select one or more CSV files and import
4. Duplicates are automatically skipped based on trade IDs

**EPFO Provident Fund:**

## Data Storage

All portfolio data is stored locally in `portfolio.json`. No data is sent to any server — API calls are only made to fetch live/historical prices.

## Future Plans

- **Asset rebalancing suggestions** — Target allocation vs actual allocation with rebalance recommendations. Expected CAGR/YoY returns based on current asset split.
- **Export** — Download portfolio data as CSV/Excel
- **More Investments** - Real estate, US investments (most probably in a separate sheet/tab)
